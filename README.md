In this repository you will find:
1.	Software. This experiment is programmed in oTree. For more information about how to use it, please consult the documentation. LABEL does not provide assistance if the experimental software is not compatible with newer versions. Experimenters should seek support from the developer and make the appropriate adjustments to the code.
2.	Instructions.
3.	Data. Each group of 6 students is considered a session. oTree generates 3 files  for each group: (i) a file with a summary for each individual (All_Apps) (ii) a file with the details of moves in real time (Action) and (iii) a file with a summary for each round (Summary). We programmed oTree to generate those datasets to facilitate the pre-processing. The data was combined and processed using a Python 3 Code in Jupyter 6.0.1. We created anonymized files with the variables of interest at the network level and at the individual level. 
4.	Code. Statistical analysis was performed in R. We used standard libraries (psych, Hmisc, ggplot2) to perform standard analysis and create visualization. We also created a code to model our algorithms and generate simulations.
